        <h3 > Who am I ? </h3>
            <p>I am Raj, A 19 years old BCA student. Doing random stuffs, want to explore the Programming world. </p>
        <h3 >What was the first programming language that you learned?</h3>
            <p>C was the first programming language in my 1st semester. Though in Lockdown, I had picked up a fair amount of JavaScript and Python. I making my first math-based game with python. BTW I'm very terrible at math.</p>
        <h3 >What do you enjoy about programming?</h3>
            <p>I love looking through code so I can find errors and fix them. In fact, I’ve always loved fixing things methodically. Also it's lot better then my class 12 Geography and History Paper.</p>
        <h3 >What’s the hardest thing about working as a computer programmer?</h3>
            <p>As much as I love sitting at my laptop and solving problems, create bugs then fix it. But I need regular breaks to maintain my focus, and I think the hardest part is avoid Chill and focus on your project.</p>
        <h3 >What’s your favorite programming language?</h3>
            <p>I love using Python because it’s such an great language with so many purposes. I learned Python when lockdown started. Python makes it often easy for developers, write less and readable codes.</p>
        <h3 >Can you tell me about your favorite programming project?</h3>
            <p>This Website, that you're currently visiting.</p>
        <h3 >What’s the most recent language that you learned?</h3>
            <p>I probably don’t keep up with as many new languages as I should, but I’ve learned a lot since lockdown. Recently I just try the <a href="https://golang.org/">golang</a> language.</p>
